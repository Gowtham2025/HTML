    <h1 class="a1">About Tata Nano:</h1>
    <p class="b1">The Tata Nano is a compact city car that was manufactured and marketed by Indian automaker Tata Motors over a single generation, primarily in India, as an inexpensive rear-engined hatchback intended to appeal to current riders of motorcycles and scooters — with a launch price of ₹100,000 or US$1,300 on 10 January 2008.[5]</p>
    <h2 class="a1">History:</h2>
    <p class="b1">After successfully launching the low cost Tata Ace truck in 2005, Tata Motors began development of an affordable passenger car that would appeal to the many Indians who ride motorcycles.[12] The purchase price of this no frills auto was brought down by dispensing with most nonessential features, reducing the amount of steel used in its construction, and relying on low cost Indian labour.[citation needed]. This led to reductions like the passenger's side wing mirror, one wiper blade, only three lug nuts per wheel or removal of the fuel filler cap from the tank.[13] Tata said it was the first time a 2-cylinder petrol engine was being used in a car with single balancer shaft. </p>
    <h2 class="a1">Expectations and effects:</h2>
    <p class="b1">Expectations created for the car during the run up to its production were commented as being out of proportion with realised sales. A 2008 study by Indian rating agency CRISIL projected the Nano would expand the nation's car market by 65%,[16] but, as of late 2012, news reports have detailed the underwhelming response of the Indian consumer to the offering; sales in the first two fiscal years after the car's unveiling remained steady at about 70,000 units. Tata intended to maintain a capacity to produce the car in much larger quantities, some 250,000 per year, should the need arise.</p>
