        <h1>Birds</h1>
        <p>Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves (/ˈeɪviːz/), characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) ostrich. <img  id="im1" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/77/de/60/77de609bd383c33943cb64fdf36cd768.jpg" alt="" height="100" width="150"> There are about ten thousand living species, more than half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which are modified forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly.</p>
        <h1>Bison</h1>
        <p>Bison are large bovines in the genus Bison (Greek: "wild ox" (bison)[1]) within the tribe Bovini. Two extant and numerous extinct species are recognised.Of the two surviving species, the American bison, B. bison, found only in North America, is the more numerous. <img id="im2" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/American_bison_k5680-1.jpg/330px-American_bison_k5680-1.jpg" alt="" height="100" width="150"> Although colloquially referred to as a buffalo in the United States and Canada,[2] it is only distantly related to the true buffalo. The North American species is composed of two subspecies.</p>

                <h2>Terminology</h2>
                <p>In general, the same words are used in different parts of the world, but with minor differences in the definitions. The terminology described here contrasts the differences in definition between the United Kingdom and other British-influenced parts of the world such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and the United States.</p>

                    <h2>Anatomy</h2>
                    <p>Cattle are large quadrupedal ungulate mammals with cloven hooves. Most breeds have horns, which can be as large as the Texas Longhorn or small like a scur. Careful genetic selection has allowed polled (hornless) cattle to become widespread.</p>
