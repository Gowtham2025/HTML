    <h2>Tata Consumer Products</h2>
    <p class="a1">Tata Consumer Products is an Indian fast-moving consumer goods company with its corporate headquarter in Mumbai, and is a part of the Tata Group.[5] Its registered office is located in Kolkata. It is the world's second-largest manufacturer and distributor of tea and a major producer of coffee.</p>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p class="a1">In the early 1980s, the tea industry in India was experiencing rising input and labour costs and dwindling margins as well as high taxes. India was facing competition on the world market not just from China, but also from other countries entering the business.</p>
    <h4>1980 to 1990</h4>
    <p class="a1">In 1983, Tata Tea bought the stake belonging to the James Finlay group to form the individual entity Tata Tea. In the same year, the company decided to move from the commodities business to consumer branding. The first brand Tata Tea was introduced. This was followed by other brands like Kannan Devan, Agni, Gemini and Chakra Gold. In spite of being the largest market in the world, the concept of branded tea took time to be accepted.[citation needed.</p>
