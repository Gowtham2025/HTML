    <h1>Stock Market</h1>
    <p class="a1">A stock market, equity market, or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers of stocks, which represent ownership claims on businesses; these may include securities listed on a public stock.</p>
    <h2>Common and Preferred Stock</h2>
    <p class="a1">Common stock—sometimes referred to as ordinary shares—represents partial ownership in a company. This stock class entitles investors to generated profits, usually paid in dividends. Common stockholders elect a company's board of directors and vote on corporate policies. Holders of this stock class have rights to a company's assets in a liquidation event, but only after preferred stock shareholders and other debt holders have been paid. Company founders and employees typically receive common stock.</p>
    <h3>Growth Stocks vs. Value Stocks</h3>
    <p class="a1">As their name suggests, growth stocks refer to equities expected to grow at a faster rate compared to the broader market. Generally, growth stocks tend to outperform during times of economic expansion and when interest rates are low. For instance, technology stocks have significantly outperformed in recent years, fueled by a robust economy and access to cheap funding. Investors can monitor growth stocks by following the themed exchange-traded fund (ETF), the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF.</p>
    <h4>Income Stocks</h4>
    <p class="a1">Income stocks are equities that provide regular income by distributing a company's profits, or excess cash, through dividends that are higher than the market average. Typically, these stocks—think utilities—have lower volatility and less capital appreciation than growth stocks, making them suitable for risk-averse investors who seek a regular income stream. Investors can access income stocks through the Amplify High Income ETF (YYY).
