    <h1>About Milk</h1>
    <p>The principal constituents of milk are <b> water, fat, proteins, lactose (milk sugar) and minerals (salts)</b>. Milk also contains trace amounts of other substances such as <b>pigments, enzymes, vitamins, phospholipids (substances with fatlike properties), and gases</b>.
    </p>    
    <h2>Atoms in Milk</h2>
    <p>The atom is <u>the smallest building block </u> of all matter in nature and cannot be divided chemically. <b> A substance</b> in which all the atoms are of the same kind is called an <i> element </i>. More than 100 elements are known today. </p>
    <h3>Ions in Milk</h3>
    <p>An atom may <i> lose or gain </i> one or more electrons. Such an atom is <del> no longer electrically neutral</del>. It is called an ion. If the ion contains more electrons <ins> than protons it is negatively </ins>charged, but if it has <i> lost one or more electrons </i>it is positively charged.</p>
    <h4>Chemical Formula in Milk</h4>
    <p>It's composed of two sugar subunits: galactose and glucose. The chemical formula for lactose is C <sub>12</sub>H<sup>22</sup>O<sub>11</sub></p>
    <h5>Milk Fat</h5>
    <p>It has a thickness of 10<sup>-10</sup> and width of 10<sup>-9</sup> and it has power of 100<sup>12</sup></p>
